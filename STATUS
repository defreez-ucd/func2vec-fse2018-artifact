Reusable 

This artifact includes sufficient code to run the experiments described in the paper, and python scripts for running func2vec on any LLVM bitcode file.
The func2vec tool has all of the options parameterized and can be run on the command line in the docker container with very little setup.

There are just four steps for any target program that can be compiled with LLVM:
	0) Generate a bitcode file (bitcode included for Linux in artifact)
	1) Walk the bitcode file (python2 -m walker walk -h, see README for exact commands)
	2) Train a model from the walk (python2 -m walker train -h, see README for exact commands)
	3) Do something with the model (check the similarity of functions, run the paper evaluations, etc.)

The func2vec tool can be run on any LLVM bitcode file, but the error-handling specification mining script is specific to Linux at this time.
