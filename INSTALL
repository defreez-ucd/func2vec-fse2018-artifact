The func2vec / program2vec source code is included in this artifact, but two auxiliary files must be downloaded:

1. The docker container with func2vec dependencies (alternatively, this can be built locally).

	Because fun2vec has a large number of dependencies, including a specific version of LLVM (3.8.1),
	func2vec is run inside a docker container to faciliate reproducibility.

	The docker container is provided as a tar file that can be directly imported.

2. The data directory containing the files neceessary to run the experiments described in the paper.

	A description of each file in the data directory is included in README.rst

If you want to perform the paper experiments or download the pre-built docker container, DOWNLOAD THESE FILES:
	The docker container is available at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sgkFNrhnmehP-pm1ZwONuqBgggQhST7L
	The data directory is available at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WrmJKJ6Us-81VZyMbMo4bs7ynSAz6ATh

Depending on the speed of your internet connection, it might be faster to rebuild the docker container. See README.

The data directory must be unzipped inside the artifact directory. The tree should look like this:

func2vec-paper34-pathbased-function-embeddings/
	data/
	src/
	...

See "Running the docker container" in README.rst
